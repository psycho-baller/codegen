# Codegen challenge

You can check out the list of iterations I went through in my [main.ipynb](main.ipynb) notebook.

I then decided to make a web page to display the visualization so it would be more internactive. You can check it out [here](https://code-challenge-visualization.herokuapp.com/).

Or run it locally:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install express
node server.js
```
